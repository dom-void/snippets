## `ovh-free-domains-results.js`

This script can simulate typing a domain name in the search box, clicking the "search", then clicking "more results" as long, as there are still any results to show on the [OVH domain search](https://www.ovh.pl/order/webcloud/?#/webCloud/domain) page. Finally it returns all the results in a `.csv` file format.
